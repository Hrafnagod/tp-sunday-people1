// Sunday toy problem for the weekend warriors out there

// Two beggars problem:
// In the city, two (friendly) beggars found a bunch of gold, stacked into neatly arranged columns, each of different height.
// The beggars decided to share the gold, each picking from the far right or the far left of the pile.

/* 
Example:
For golds = [4,2,9,5,2,7], the output should be [14,15].
The pile of most left is 4, 
The pile of most right is 7, 
A choose the largest one -- > take 7

The pile of most left is 4, 
The pile of most right is 2, 
B choose the largest one -- > take 4

The pile of most left is 2, 
The pile of most left is 2, 
A choose the most left one -- > take 2

Etc. 

The function should return the two values in an array with two elements: [beggarValue1, beggarValue2]
